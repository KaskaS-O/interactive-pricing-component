## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The biggest challenge was to handle and style input range. As it's described on many websites - it's a nightmare of styling, especially on Chrome. It's not intuitive at all, but I managed to solve all the problems showing up on the way.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools: How TO - Range sliders](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_rangeslider.asp) - Explains some aspects of this type of input, provides ready components.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/range) - Gives some theory about inputs range.
